# dotfiles
Current Arch configuration files and scripts

## Setup:
setup.sh moves all dotfiles to this local repository and then makes symlinks in $HOME. Note: script directories are currently hardcoded.

## TODOs:
* clean-up
* sxhkd bindings
* bspwm customization
* fix spacing on polybar modules
* switch to alacritty(?)
* add spotify module to polybar
* think of more to-do's
